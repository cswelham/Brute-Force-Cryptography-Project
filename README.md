The COMPX502 Group Project is a computer program which can be used to both encrypt and decrypt messages involving the examples of cryptosystems that have been introduced in the course. 

Our computer program is written in *python* and has command line functionality. 

Our computer program implements the following cryptosystems:
   - ElGamel
   - Vigenere Cipher
   - Feistel Cipher
   - R.S.A.
   - Caesar Cipher

And the program also includes other features:
   - Encryption and Decryption Capabilities
   - Index of Coincidence Calculator
   - Letter Frequency Calculator
   - Discrete Logarithm Calculator
